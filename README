Flow is a simple "show and tell" project to demonstrate how to
write a javascript based application for interacting with FluidDB.

Flow is itself an application for writing javascript based applications with
FluidDB. 

I'll let you pause a minute while you work out the circularity of that last
sentence. ;-)

It uses the Sammy framework ( http://code.quirkey.com/sammy/index.html ), a 
modified jsFluidDB script ( http://github.com/ecarnevale/jsFluidDB ) and FluidDB
itself (for hosting and data storage).

I'm in the middle of writing a blog post detailing what I did and why and will
reference it in this README when I've finished it.

It's *VERY* incomplete - just a proof of concept really. Currently you can:

* Sign in/out
* View, create, edit and delete namespaces/tags 
* Edit tag values for mime-types text/html text/css and text/javascript (this
will be extended)
* Search for objects using the simple QL that comes with FluidDB

To use it properly you'll need to register for a username and password here:

To "install" your own instance of Flow navigate to the "python" sub-directory
and make sure you have an appropriately configured "credentials.json" file in
place (see credentials.json.example for what you should provide). Simply run the
"push.py" script to deploy the code to FluidDB (main instance - update the
script to point at the sandbox instance) and watch out for the object_id dumped to
stdout. Once complete, go visit:

http://fluiddb.fluidinfo.com/objects/[THE OBJECT ID RETURNED BY PUSH.PY]/[YOUR FLUIDDB USERNAME]/fluidapp/flow/index.html#/

Have a play, look at the code and try it out. 

Comments, suggestions and good ideas are most welcome!
